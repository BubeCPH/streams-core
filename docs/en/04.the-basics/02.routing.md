## Introduction

Routing in the Streams Platform extends Laravel routing. This documentation assumes you are already familiar with [routing in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).

## Defining Routes

### Routes File

A quick and easy way to start routing is by simply using Laravel's `routes/web.php` file. 

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('theme::pages/welcome');
});
```

### Addon Routes

Most routing is specified within the relevant addon's service provider using the `$routes` and `$api` properties.

The most basic route definition looks like this:

```php
protected $routes = [
    'example/uri' => 'Example\ExampleModule\Http\Controller\ExampleController@example',
];
```

You can optionally define more information by using an array definition.

```php
protected $routes = [
    'posts/{slug}' => [
        'verb' => 'GET',
        'as' => 'anomaly.module.posts::posts.view',
        'uses' => 'Anomaly\PostsModule\Http\Controller\PostsController@view',
        'where' => [
            'slug' => '([A-Za-z])',
        ],
        'middleware' => [
            'Example\Http\Middleware\DoSomething',
        ],
    ],
];
```

#### Map Method

Addon service providers can also use the `map` method to define routes:

```php
public function map()
{
    Route::get('/', function () {
        return view('theme::pages/welcome');
    });
}
```

### API Routes

Addon service providers can define API routes as well by specifying the `$api` parameter. All API routes automatically add the `auth:api` middleware.

```php
protected $api = [
    'api/widgets/{slug}' => 'Anomaly\StoreModule\Http\Controller\ApiController@widgets',
];
```


## Action Variables

Route `action variables` can be used for various features. The basic principle is passing along information to the handling request from the route.

For example you can define `'csrf' =. false,` to bypass `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware.

```php
protected $routes = [
    'example/route' => [
        'csrf' => false,
        'uses' => 'Anomaly\ExampleModule\Http\Controller\ExampleController@handle',
    ],
];
```


## Overriding Routes

Named routes will serve the `last` matching route. Knowing this we can override `named` routes from our custom addons which are loaded last simply by specifying a `name` that was defined earlier.

The below example overrides the default `view` route for `posts` within the `posts module`. Note that we use the existing controller, we are only overriding the URI.

```php
protected $routes = [
    'press/{slug}' => [
        'as' => 'anomaly.module.posts::posts.view',
        'uses' => 'Anomaly\PostsModule\Http\Controller\PostsController@view',
    ],
];
```
