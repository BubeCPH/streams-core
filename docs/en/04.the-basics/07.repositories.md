# Repositories

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

The `repository` pattern is how we separate `database` and `entity` code.

Repositories wrap a `model` and should provide all database operations (save, update, find, etc). Note that Laravel models can handle this and _they do_ handle it **within repositories**. The separation of logic and application purpose is what is gained. This is a crucial separation and is considered best practice in our architecture.

## Defining Repositories

Entry repositories are created when using the `make:addon` command.

Should you need to create one manually it would start like this:

```php
<?php namespace {namespace};

use Anomaly\Streams\Platform\Entry\EntryRepository;

class {class} extends EntryRepository
{

    /**
     * The entry model.
     *
     * @var {model}
     */
    protected $model;

    /**
     * @param {model} $model
     */
    public function __construct({model} $model)
    {
        $this->model = $model;
    }
}
```
