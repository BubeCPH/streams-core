## Introduction

Streams dispatches a number of helpful Laravel type events. You can listen for these using native Laravel methods or defining the `$listeners` property of your [addon service providers](../addon-development/service-providers).

```php
protected $listeners = [
    ApplicationHasLoaded::class => [    // Event
        TouchLastActivity::class,       // Listener
    ],
];
```
