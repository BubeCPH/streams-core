# Installation

> The Streams Platform comes setup and ready right out of the box with PyroCMS.{.notice}

## Existing Laravel Projects

You can use the Streams Platform as a basis for Laravel projects and utilize it all the same as well as leverage addons.

Before proceeding consider starting your project with a vanilla PyroCMS installation and [remove unneeded addons](/documentation/pyrocms/latest/the-basics/optimizing). You can also [fork PyroCMS](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms) and change the `composer.json` to fit your businesses needs for projects.

#### Install with Composer

First require the [composer package](https://packagist.org/packages/anomaly/streams-platform) by running `composer require anomaly/streams-platform`.

#### Register the service provider

Next you need to register the service provider with Laravel. To do this add the following service provider to the **end** of the `providers` section in `config/app.php` just as you would any other Laravel package:

```php
<?php

return [

    // ...

    'providers' => [

        // ...
        
        Anomaly\Streams\Platform\StreamsServiceProvider::class,
    ],


];

```

#### Replace the `index.php` file

Next you need to copy the `public/index.php` file from [PyroCMS's version](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/public/index.php). This simply overrides the HTTP kernel with a variant designed to deliver HTTP cache. This is a required change.

#### Register the kernels

The Streams Platform adds low level functionality to the HTTP and console kernels. In order for this to work properly you must register the kernels in the `bootstrap/app.php` file:

    $app->singleton(
        Illuminate\Contracts\Http\Kernel::class,
        'Anomaly\Streams\Platform\Http\Kernel'
    );

    $app->singleton(
        Illuminate\Contracts\Console\Kernel::class,
        'Anomaly\Streams\Platform\Console\Kernel'
    );

#### Install Streams Application

Lastly you will need to run the install which will install the database tables.

```bash
php artisan install
```
