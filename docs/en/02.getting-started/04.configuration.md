## Introduction

Streams configuration can be found in `vendor/anomaly/streams-platform/resources/config`. It is a good idea to look through the configuration files to get acquainted with what's available.

## Configurating the Streams Platform

You will notice in looking through the available cofiguration that much of it is available through environmental configuration.

### Runtime Configuration

You can override streams configuration at runtime by using the `config()` helper.

```php
config(['strams::system.force_ssl' => true]);
```

### Publishing streams configuration

In order to configure the Streams Platform without modifying core files you will need to publish the Streams Platform with the following command:

     php artisan streams:publish

You can then find the Streams Platform configuration files in `resources/{application}/streams/config`.

### Publishing addon configuration

In order to configure addons without modifying core files you will need to publish the addon with the following command:

     php artisan addon:publish vendor.type.slug

You can then find the addon configuration files in `resources/{application}/{vendor}/{slug}-{type}/config`.
