## Releases

### [1.6.155] - 2019-06-18
#### Fixed
- Fixed issue in `\Anomaly\Streams\Platform\Model\EloquentFormRepository` where translatable information was on the base level of the update data causing translatable content to not always be saved correctly. 


### [1.6.154] - 2019-06-14
#### Added
- Added `translatable` label to `\Anomaly\Streams\Platform\Stream\StreamPresenter::labels`.

#### Fixed
- Fixed `\Anomaly\Streams\Platform\Model\EloquentObserver::deleting` to return `true` if not returning `false`.
- Fixed `\Anomaly\Streams\Platform\Version\Command\SaveVersion` to store deeper relations. This opens support for type pattern entry model block content. Pages and posts with block content for example.

### [1.6.145] - 2019-05-15

### [1.6.144] - 2019-05-14
#### Fixed
